## For Production iOS Implementation

To implement actual Tap to Pay on iPhone, you'll need to:

### 1. iOS App Development
Create a native iOS app or add Terminal SDK to existing iOS app:

```bash
# Add to your iOS project
pod 'StripeTerminal', '~> 3.9.0'
```

### 2. Required Entitlements
Add to your iOS app's entitlements file:
```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.proximity-reader.payment.acceptance</key>
<true/>
```

### 3. iOS Implementation Example
```swift
import StripeTerminal

class PaymentViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Initialize Terminal
        Terminal.setTokenProvider(self)
        Terminal.shared.delegate = self
    }
    
    func collectPayment() {
        // Create PaymentIntent (use your existing API)
        // Then collect payment method
        Terminal.shared.collectPaymentMethod(paymentIntent) { result, error in
            if let paymentIntent = result {
                // Confirm the payment
                Terminal.shared.confirmPaymentIntent(paymentIntent) { result, error in
                    // Handle result
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

extension PaymentViewController: ConnectionTokenProvider {
    func fetchConnectionToken(_ completion: @escaping ConnectionTokenCompletionBlock) {
        // Fetch from your /api/admin/connection-token endpoint
    }
}
```

### 4. Required iOS Permissions
Add to Info.plist:
```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Location access is required to accept payments.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses Bluetooth to connect to supported card readers.</string>
```

### 5. Apple Review Process
- Submit app to Apple for Tap to Pay entitlement review
- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for Tap to Pay
- Include proper merchant education in your app

## Web-Based Solutions (Available Now!)

### 1. Payment Links + QR Codes ⭐ **Best for iOS**
- **Perfect for iOS devices** - customers pay on their own iPhone/iPad

### Alternative Options
1. **Stripe Dashboard Mobile App**: Use the official Stripe mobile app for real Tap to Pay
2. **Physical Card Readers**: Use Stripe Terminal hardware readers

## Testing

### Test Cards for Terminal
- Use Stripe test cards ending in specific numbers for different scenarios
- Amount ending in `00` = Approved
- Amount ending in `05` = Declined
- Amount ending in `03` = PIN required (where supported)

### Current Demo Features
- Search and select from all Stripe products
- Apply active coupons with real-time discount calculation
- Customer email validation
- Quantity selection
- Order summary with totals
- Simulated payment processing
- Success/failure states
- Automatic form reset after successful payment

## Security Considerations

- All payment intents are created server-side with proper validation
- Coupon codes are validated against active Stripe coupons
- Customer emails are required for all transactions
- Payment amounts are calculated server-side to prevent tampering
- All transactions include comprehensive metadata for audit trails

## Integration with Existing System

The Tap to Pay tool integrates seamlessly with:
- Existing Stripe product catalog
- Current coupon management system
- Notification system for transaction alerts
- Admin dashboard for easy access

## Next Steps for Production

1. Develop native iOS app with Terminal SDK
2. Apply for Apple Tap to Pay entitlements
3. Implement proper Terminal SDK payment flow
4. Add comprehensive error handling for Terminal-specific scenarios
5. Implement offline payment support
6. Add receipt generation and printing capabilities
7. Integrate with existing inventory management (for t-shirts)
8. Add transaction reporting and analytics
